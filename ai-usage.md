# AI Usage Documentation

AI tools were used in a limited and supportive capacity during this assessment.

## Where AI Was Used
- Assisting with structuring and refining written explanations for clarity and professionalism
- Reviewing wording to ensure technical accuracy and clear communication

## Example Prompts Used
- "Explain insecure API design risks in a SaaS platform"
- "Outline incident response steps for a data exposure vulnerability"

## How AI Output Was Handled
- Generic responses were adapted to fit the specific ClientHub architecture and scenario
- Overly abstract or non-applicable content was rejected
- All risk selection, prioritization, and mitigation decisions were based on independent analysis

## Original Analysis Added
- Attack surface selection and prioritization based on ClientHub’s system design
- Detailed API abuse scenarios aligned with realistic attacker behavior
- Incident response steps reflecting real operational and investigative constraints
