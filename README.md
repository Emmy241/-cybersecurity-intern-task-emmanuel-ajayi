## Brief Note

My approach focused on identifying realistic, high-impact security risks relevant to a growing multi-tenant SaaS platform. I prioritized attack surfaces that pose the greatest risk to data confidentiality, platform integrity, and enterprise trust, and approached each task from both attacker and defender perspectives. The recommendations emphasize practical, implementable controls aligned with real-world engineering and operational constraints.
